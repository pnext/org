# Welcome!
Welcome to `pnext`. `pnext` is a open open-source project (see: [#org](#org)) focussed on displaying [pointcloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) data.

## org
This project is organized open. All members are part of this github organization. Issue, agendas of the whole project
are discussed in the [issue](https://github.com/pnext/org/issues) tracker. All documents in this repository are live
documents - subject to change. You a are encouraged to ask questions and suggest changes on how we do things.
_(We prefer a [PR](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) over a question though...)_

Any PR on the organization needs to be approved by two **admins** (other than the person submitting the issue).

In the community we currently have two teams:
 
- **admin:** Administrators can create and archive projects.
    - [Hugo Campos](https://github.com/hccampos)
    - [Daniel Kastl](https://github.com/dkastl)
    - [Martin Heidegger](https://github.com/martinheidegger)
- **developers:** Developers have write access to all repositories.

We generally recommend that any contributor with two PR's join our organization.

## History
There has been a lot of prior work to the work, displaying pointcloud data. This project original started as fork of [potree](https://github.com/potree/potree) but also draws inspiration from [plasio](https://github.com/hobu/plasio.js),
[entwine](https://github.com/connormanning/entwine) and [Cesium](https://cesiumjs.org/).
